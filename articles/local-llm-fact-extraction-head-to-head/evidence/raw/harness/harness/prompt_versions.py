"""Render an older prompt version from the live template, by explicit reversal.

A v5-vs-v7 comparison needs both prompts on the same corpus and the same server,
but prompt.py deliberately holds exactly one template -- the one production
sends -- and verifies it byte-for-byte against the C source. Keeping a second
copy of v5 here would defeat that check the moment either drifted.

So older versions are DERIVED from the live one by named substitutions, and each
substitution asserts it matched. If the live wording moves, this raises instead
of silently producing a prompt that is neither version.

# pass at all under the live prompt. That is either the model or the prompt, and
# the project has already been burned once by assuming the former: on gemma-4-E4B
# a single sentence, "No prose, no markdown.", suppressed reasoning across 10,000
# notes while every row recorded thinking:true, and restoring it was worth +0.116
# relation-agnostic recall. E2B, same family, never had the behaviour.

# "does this prompt suppress this model's reasoning channel". Neither produces a
# number comparable to the ranking table: a model scored under a different prompt
# is a different configuration, exactly as a different process count is. Every
# prediction row records its own prompt_version, so nothing banked is touched and
# nothing can be silently mixed.
